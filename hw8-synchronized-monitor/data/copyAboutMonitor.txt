1. What is a Monitor?
A monitor can be considered as a building which contains a special room.
The special room can be occupied by only one customer(thread) at a time.
The room usually contains some data and code.
If a customer wants to occupy the special room, he has to enter the Hallway(Entry Set) to wait first.
Scheduler will pick one based on some criteria(e.g. FIFO).
If he is suspended for some reason, he will be sent to the wait room, and be scheduled to reenter the special room later.
As it is shown in the diagram above, there are 3 rooms in this building.
In brief, a monitor is a facility which monitors the threads' access to the special room.
It ensures that only one thread can access the protected data or code.
