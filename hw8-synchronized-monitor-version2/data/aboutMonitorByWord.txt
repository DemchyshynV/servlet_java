What
is
a
Monitor?
The
special
room
can
be
occupied
by
only
one
customer(thread)
at
a
time.
If
a
customer
wants
to
occupy
the
special
room,
he
has
to
enter
the
Hallway(Entry
Set)
to
wait
first.
If
he
is
suspended
for
some
reason,
he
will
be
sent
to
the
wait
room,
and
be
scheduled
to
reenter
the
special
room
later.
In
brief,
a
monitor
is
a
facility
which
monitors
the
threads'
access
to
the
special
room.
