A monitor can be considered as a building which contains a special room.
The room usually contains some data and code.
Scheduler will pick one based on some criteria(e.g. FIFO).
As it is shown in the diagram above, there are 3 rooms in this building.
It ensures that only one thread can access the protected data or code.
